# Dictionary
Pure Java, Knot Tree made of letters of words. Each word is broken into letters and added to the dictionary.
Each sequence of letters is unique, for example, if we add a word  "cleaner", and,after that word cleaning only “ing” will be added.
Implemented two interfaces void addWord (String word); void printWordByPrefix (string prefix);
No java collection, no java array is used. Easily can be transfered to generic type.
